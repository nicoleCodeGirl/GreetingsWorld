	"bio" : "My hobbies include crocheting, anything sci-fi and reading. I've been told that I often act older than my young years. My favorite animal is an octopus and my favorite color is orange. I love to train service dogs during my free time. Currently I am training a terrier mix named Sparky who I just adore....although I think the feeling is mutual. I plan on going to law school to become a lawyer and would love to work in the tech field as well. My ultimate dream is to start a non-profit which would promote restorative justice opportunities for the community. A few items on my bucket list include: visiting the Smithsonian, helping to make a Rose Parade float and reading every book ever written by C.S. Lewis.",

Everyday I wake up thanking God for another day. I keep striving every moment that comes my way by keeping a positive attitude. I work out weekend mornings to keep up the good energy. I have a beautiful family that cannot wait for me to come home. I love penguins because once they find their mate they stay together forever.\r\nLastly I have committed this year to live for the moment and not worry about tomorrow, love myself and be kind to everyone around me.",

	"bio" : "HI my name is Rianne. People always pronounce my name wrong and I find it super irritating, even though I do not correct people most of the time. I am outgoing and closed off at the same time. Do not ask me how that works because I could not tell you. I'm majoring in sociology and desire to obtain a masters degree. I honestly do not know what field of work I want to go into. I just like learning about life, people, social structures, culture, and systemic impacts. My love language is gifts! Omg how I love a good gift ü•∞. I feel prettiest when I am fresh out of the shower. My favorite colors are purple, pink, mint, and deep red. Cool colors right? I love children. I find myself passionate about womens' rights and prison reform. The person who inspires me the most is my mother. Her strength and resilience makes her my hero. I love the way she refuses to give up no matter how hard life gets for her. I try to embody her strength when I find myself in hard times. I am awesome, fearless, resilient, intellectual, and down to earth.",

Ever since I was a little girl, I have had my own computer. I remember my dad taking me to work when I was about 6 and I changed his desktop to all sorts of rainbow fonts and backgrounds and he was curious how I did it. \"I just opened up every file, dad!\" Ha. I love to learn. I have always wanted to study coding since I was young. I also love math and I got my A.S in Accounting. I love butterflies, sunflowers, and sunsets. ",
